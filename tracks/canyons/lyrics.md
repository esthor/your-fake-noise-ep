# Canyons

I open my eyes
I’m here again.
Almost out of it,
But something,
Something,
Something holds me back.

I run through these cycles,
Nothing new to shake my view,
I need to find something,
To make, make me whole.
Make me whole.

I’m trapped again,
The vestiges have me gripped
Can’t someone pull me, pull me out?
No one hears my mute screams
Can’t I touch something else, something new?
Something new.

I’m trapped again.

I need something new.

Welcome, my friends.
Welcome.

Welcome.
Welcome once again, to the canyon,
Of dead ideas, they rise to you,
To block your view.
The canyon, canyon, the canyon.

I need to find new lies,
To believe.
These don’t fit me.
Blame my experience

This ephemeral is real.

Goodbye, my friends.
I will leave the canyon.
I can make it this time.

Now ending,
Please look down
